# Shopping List – Simple React To-Buy App

**Shopping List** is a basic React app that lets users add grocery items, mark them as done, and remove them. It’s perfect for learning and practicing React’s key features such as `useState`, array manipulation, and conditional rendering.

## Features

- Add items to your list
- Mark items as completed (crossed out)
- Remove items from the list
- Responsive and minimal design

## What You'll Practice

- useState for managing dynamic lists
- Handling form inputs with controlled components
- Array methods like `map`, `filter`, and `splice`
- Conditional rendering and styles (e.g., line-through when completed)
- Component composition (InputForm, ItemList, Item)

## Tech Stack

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS (or Tailwind CSS)
- Vite or Create React App (for setup)
